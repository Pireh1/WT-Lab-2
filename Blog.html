			<h2>Amazing Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
			<p>October 24,2018__ 254 Comments</p>

				<header>
					<h3>For years, I’ve been searching for my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe.</h3>
				</header>

				<p>I want outrageously delicious bakery-style chocolate chip cookies that completely capture my attention upon first bite. I want a chewy middle, barely crisp edges, complex flavor, and rich chocolate chips.</p>

<p>I want all of that in a cookie recipe that’s easy to make. No mixer required. No creaming of softened-but-not-too-soft butter. No chilling the dough for 24 hours. I don’t have the patience for any of that. Sometimes a girl just needs a cookie!</p>

				<h3>These chocolate chip cookies are the best hommade chocolate chip cookies I've ever had.</h3>

				<p>My cookie search is over.<br> These cookies are so delicious and supremely easy to make. The dough needs a very reasonable 30-minute chill in the refrigerator, and let me tell you, they're worth the brief wait.</p>

			<h2>Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Crispy Baked Tofu with Honey-Sesame Glaze</h2>

					<h3>Have you made this recipe already, by chance?</h3>
				</header>

					<p>You’re looking at roasted Brussels sprouts and crispy baked tofu over brown rice, drizzled with an irresistible honey-sesame glaze that brings it all together. This recipe features a few staple Asian ingredients, but it’s not one you’ll find on a takeout menu.</p>
					<p>It’s one of my favorites from four years ago, but I was afraid the photos weren’t doing it justice. Over the weekend, it got some new beauty shots, and I’m sharing it again with some new notes!</p>

					<img src="tofu.jpg">

				<p>This dish reminds me of one of the Annie’s frozen meals that I used to take into my office job when I was starting this blog, the broccoli teriyaki one. Maybe you know it. This is its homemade counterpart, which would coincidentally pack great for an office lunch.</p>

<p>While this recipe requires making several components, I love how the recipe comes together. You can bake the Brussels and the tofu in the oven at the same time, which might seem complicated at first glance, but it’s absolutely not! While those bake, the rice and glaze will be simmering on the stove. Then, it’s assembly time and dinner time.</p>

<p>In fact, I love this recipe so much that it inspired one of the recipes in my cookbook—the Roasted Broccoli, Bell Pepper, and Tofu Bowl with Peanut Sauce on page 175. I get hungry just looking at its photo. So good! </p>

					<h3>Apple & Carrot “Superhero” Muffins</h3>
					<p>October 18, 2018__ 138 Comments</p>

				<p>In the mood for some fall baking? Me, too! I’m cozying up with these apple carrot muffins and a cup of coffee. Cookie is hoping for some crumbs.</p>

<p>My sweet publisher sent me a cookbook called Run Fast. Cook Fast. Eat Slow. a few months ago. The cookbook was co-written by Olympian/NYC Marathon champ Shalane Flanagan and chef/nutrition coach Elyse Kopecky.</p>

<p>I should confess that I hate running and only qualify for the “hangry” portion of the book’s subtitle, “Quick-Fix Recipes for Hangry Athletes.”</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the book is up my alley because it’s full of energizing, whole foods-based recipes. I haven’t been able to get this hybrid apple-carrot muffin recipe out of my mind. They didn’t disappoint!</p>

<img src="muffin.jpg">

<p>The authors call these muffins “superhero” muffins because they are muffins that sustain. They offered three versions in the book, and I chose the muffins featuring grated fresh carrots and Granny Smith apples.</p>

<p>These muffins are very hearty and wholesome, which makes them perfect grab-and-go breakfasts or snacks. I think they would freeze well for several months, if you want to keep them on hand for hangry moments.</p>

<p>Bonus? These muffins are gluten free and naturally sweetened, and easy to mix up by hand. Apple carrot muffins for the win.</p>

			<h2>29 Delicious Vegan Dinner Recipes</h2>

					<h3>Delicious Vegan Dinners!</h3>
				</header>

				<p>Where did the weekend go? Serious question. I enjoyed a few too many heavy meals over the past few days, so I thought we could lighten up a little with my favorite vegan dinners.</p>

<p>You won’t find any weird meat substitutes here. You’ll find <b>wholesome vegan meals</b> made with protein-rich whole grains, beans, and nuts. You’ll also see plenty of fresh, colorful produce, and occasionally some tofu.</p>

<p>As a vegetarian, a lot of my recipes happen to be vegan, or would be if I simply left off the sprinkle of cheese. I love the challenge of making my favorite cheesy recipes vegan, like when I figured out how to make vegan versions of the lasagna and enchiladas for my cookbook.</p>

<p><b>If you’re looking to reduce your consumption of animal products, you’re in the right place</b>. I’ve picked out 29 favorite recipes to highlight today. You’ll find lots of comments below proving that even the most adamant carnivores can fall in love with vegan meals!</p>

<p>You can browse my vegan recipe index to see all of my options on Cookie and Kate. For even more, check out my cookbook, Love Real Food, which offers 96 tested vegan/vegan-option recipes. I worked so hard to make the vegan options just as tempting as the originals.</p>

<p>If you make any of these recipes,<b> please let me know how they turn out for you in the comments.</b> I really love hearing from you!</p>
